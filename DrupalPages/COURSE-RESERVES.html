<h2>Course Reserves</h2>

<p>Each semester, Milne Library staff examine the list of faculty textbook requests. We move any library-owned title to <strong>4-hour reserve</strong> in order to benefit a higher number of students.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Faculty are strongly encouraged to <span class="underline"><a href="https://www.geneseo.edu/library/support-milne-library">donate copies of textbooks</a></span> for this highly circulating collection.</strong></p>

<p>Students can ask for these textbooks by title at the Service Desk. <strong>Including the call number in your syllabus</strong> can be helpful.</p>

<p>Additional materials such as course readings, DVDs, and CDs can also be placed on reserve.</p>

<ul>
	<li><a href="https://librarydataportal.geneseo.edu/Requests/CirculatingReserves.aspx">Fill out the online form</a></li>
	<li>Bring materials to the library Service Desk&nbsp;(either in person or via Campus Mail).</li>
</ul>

<p>For items already owned by Milne Library, we can move them from the stacks to Reserves.</p>
