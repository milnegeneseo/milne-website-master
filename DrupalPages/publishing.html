<p>In response to the growing impact of <strong>Open Educational Resources (OER) </strong>adoption across SUNY, the <a href="http://textbooks.opensuny.org">Open SUNY Textbook (OST)/Open SUNY OER Services </a>project is offering services to support wide faculty adoption of OER that can be effectively sustained, improved and shared, as well as delivered to students to give them the day-one access to course materials they need for academic success. Our OER services will continue to include supporting the development of new, original low-cost learning materials for SUNY students, using a financial model that any SUNY campus can easily join. These new and continuing services provide faculty with a common platform to remix, revise, reuse, redistribute, and retain openly-licensed content from any source, including their own original works.</p>

<p><a href="http://textbooks.opensuny.org"><strong>SUNY OER Services</strong></a> is a scaled-up, networked, and sustainable approach to digital learning and publishing within the SUNY system, using curated OER content, faculty course supports, and instructional technology development and design.<a href="http://opensuny.org"><img alt="" src="/sites/default/files/sites/library/Publishing-Digital-Projects/Icon_Sarrazin-170x170.jpg" style="border-width: 0px; border-style: solid; margin: 5px; float: right; width: 170px; height: 170px;" /></a></p>

Clapper's magisterial 1967 dissertation, <i>The Development of Walden: A Genetic Text</i> (UCLA, 1967), has long been an indispensable to Thoreau scholars for its insights into Thoreau’s writing process, as evidenced by the original <i>Walden</i> manuscript (HM 924) at the <a href="http://www.huntington.org/">Huntington Library</a> in San Marino, California. Key to <i>Clapper’s Genetic Text</i> is the idea that <i>Walden</i>’s ten-year writing period could be divided into seven different chronological stages, or versions. Students in professor Paul Schacht's Literature in the Digital Age class along with &nbsp;Milne Library’s Technical Services department encoded the <img alt="" height="185" src="/sites/default/files/sites/library/Publishing-Digital-Projects/Digital-Thoreau/fluid_larger_shadow.png" style="margin: 5px; float: right;" width="189" />text of Professor Clapper’s dissertation into TEI XML, and utilizing web-based tool called the Versioning Machine, published a fluid text edition of Walden which allows readers to read its full text at any of these identified stages of development.<br />

Looking out across the river, it’s not just the breadth of landscape that amazes but what you might call the depth of time. Trying to think about our area’s past and its ecology together is the goal of <a href="http://openvalley.org">OpenValley</a>; it uses archival materials to create historical exhibits with a contemporary focus upon sustainability.<br />

	<li><a href="http://www.geneseo.edu/library/publishing/digital_projects#livingston">Livingston County Historical Society - </a> Local History and Material Culture in Livingston County, NY is an Omeka website in progress created for use by Prof. Catherine Adams’ HIST 221 (Research in History) students, for cataloging, describing, contextualizing, and exhibiting objects, images, and documents relating to the historical material culture of the area surrounding SUNY Geneseo. Omeka, an open source web-publishing platform, offers students a wide range of options for presenting their research products, well beyond the traditional research paper or in-class presentation. In the project’s first semester (fall 2013), students worked closely with Prof. Adams, as well as with Milne’s special collections librarian, information technology professionals, and Livingston County Museum staff to add items and create an exhibit focusing on the Craig Colony for Epileptics in Sonyea, NY. Additional items and exhibits will be added each semester that Prof. Adams’ HIST 221 course is taught.<br />

The Geneseo Geoscience Collections is an ongoing project to catalog and describe the items in this collection. Initial work on the project was completed by directed study student Amanda Lanik, and geology majors have added to the online catalog over the past two years. &nbsp;While the site can serve as a finding aid for rock and mineral samples, students have also added extensive metadata and references to the geological literature. As a result, the <a href="http://www.geosciencecollections.milne-library.org/">Geneseo Geosciences Collection</a> can be used as a starting place for research on the items in the collection.<br />
