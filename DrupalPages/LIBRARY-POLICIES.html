<h2>Regional Borrowing Privileges</h2>

<p>Milne Library is a member of the <strong><a href="http://rrlc.org/">Rochester Regional Library Council</a></strong>, a library network which provides programs and services to member libraries. One of these services is the RRLC Access Card Program, a cooperative effort of area libraries to aid research by graduate students, faculty members and professionals in our community.</p>

<p>All currently enrolled graduate students, faculty members and staff of SUNY Geneseo are welcome to apply for a RRLC Access Card which provides borrowing privileges at participating Rochester-area institutions such as RIT, University of Rochester, St. John Fisher and <a href="http://rrlc.org/tabid/498/mid/857/default.aspx">more</a>.</p>

<p>RRLC Access Cards are issued to applicants only when research materials in the applicant’s own library cannot satisfy the researcher’s needs. The RRLC Access Card is a borrower’s card only and does not entitle the holder to library services other than circulation services.</p>
