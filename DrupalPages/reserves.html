<h1>Reserves</h1>

<h2>Circulating Reserves</h2>

<p>Each semester, Milne Library staff examine the list of faculty textbook requests. We move any library-owned title to <strong>4-hour reserve</strong> in order to benefit a higher number of students.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Faculty are strongly encouraged to <a href="https://www.geneseo.edu/library/support-milne-library">donate copies of textbooks</a> for this highly circulating collection.</strong></p>

<p>Students can ask for these textbooks by title at the Service Desk. <strong>Including the call number in your syllabus</strong> can be helpful.</p>

<p>Additional materials such as course readings, DVDs, and CDs can also be placed on reserve.</p>

<ul>
	<li><a href="http://intranetlib.geneseo.edu/DataPortal/Requests/CirculatingReserves.aspx">Fill out the online form</a></li>
	<li>Bring materials to the library Service Desk&nbsp;(either in person or via Campus Mail).</li>
</ul>

<p>For items already owned by Milne Library, we can move them from the stacks to Reserves.</p>

<h2>Electronic Reserves</h2>

<p><span style="font-size:28px;"><strong style="font-size: 28px; color: #ff0000;">Milne Library no longer manages electronic reserves for faculty. </strong></span></p>

<p>Faculty can easily manage electronic course materials myCourses. Current <a href="http://www.geneseo.edu/mycourses" target="_blank">myCourses self-help guides</a>&nbsp;can assist faculty with the process.</p>

<p>Faculty with prior electronic reserves managed by the library can contact&nbsp;<a href="mailto:ha@geneseo.edu">Corey Ha</a>&nbsp;(585-245-5591)&nbsp;for additional help and information.</p>
