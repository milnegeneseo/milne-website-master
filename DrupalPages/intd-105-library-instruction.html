<h2>Making the most out of a library session</h2>
<ul><li>Library sessions should be scheduled close to the time when students begin their research-based projects.</li>
<li>To maximize a library session, students should have a clear understanding of their assigned project and have a good idea of a potential topic.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Consider developing research-based assignments in consultation with a librarian.</li>
<li>Students focus more fully in a library session when the lesson relates to an upcoming research-based assignment.</li>
<li>The chosen learning objectives above represent a realistic amount of content that can be covered in a one-time 50-minute session.&nbsp; If professors desire training that goes beyond these objectives, a second library session is highly recommended.</li>
<li>Past research indicates that students score higher on library skills assessment if they attend more than one session of library instruction.</li></ul>
<p>Geneseo librarians would greatly appreciate your participation in future INTD 105 assessments of library skills.</p>
